## Aiden Kim's home page
Welcome to my page.

## About Me
My name is Aiden and I am 16 years old. I was born in Canada, but moved to San Diego when I was very young. I enjoy playing the guitar, hanging out with friends & family, and video games. My favorite subjects are Chemistry and Math.

## My Freeform Image
I chose to draw a picture of Walter White from Breaking Bad because it is my favorite show. He is holding the Korean Flag because I am Korean and he is also holding a controller because I like playing video games.
